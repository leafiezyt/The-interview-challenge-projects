# The-interview-challenge-projects
In the past several months, I have been having multiple interviews done. Almost all the HM gave me some kind of challenge projects/analysis work. All were performed using public available datasets. Topics are mostly very diverse. Essence are all the same. How to utilize genomics/bioinformatics approaches to tackle a certain question, mostly biology related. I thought that these are fun to share with the peers and colleagues. 

Imagine these are brain teasing games.
Enjoy!
